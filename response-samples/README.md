These are redacted versions of output from various parts. The purpose
of these is to show what is typical for a particular usage.

* `.heads` -- these are output from `curl`'s `--dump-header` options
* `.out` -- these are `print DEBUG` to the .out file in `lunch`
* `.param` -- these are `print DEBUG` to the .param file in `lunch`

* `button.*` -- these are from a button push event in Slack
* `help.*` -- these are from a `/lunchbot help` event in Slack
* `poll.*` -- post a poll to Slack via `curl`, I was looking for headers indicating quota / rate limiting
